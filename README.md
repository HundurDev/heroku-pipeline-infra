# Lesson 7
In this lesson we will look at how we can use Heroku to achieve our gaols of immutable artifacts,
environment parity and consistent builds.

You can use this repository as a starting point.

## Setup your environment

Set the two required environment variables in your shell

* GITHUB_TOKEN (Personal access token)
* HEROKU_API_KEY  

The Heroku key can be found in your user profile @ Heroku. The GITHUB token is a [personal access
token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)

## Change terraform files

- modify the two provider files
- modify the variables.tf file to make it your own.
